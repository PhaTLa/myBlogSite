## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Toolkit

I'm passionate about building and optimizing the bridges between development and operations. Here's what I bring to the table:

### CI/CD & DevOps Pipeline
My expertise lies in crafting seamless **CI/CD pipelines** that fit various project needs. I have hands-on experience with:
- **Jenkins** - Traditional automation server
- **GitLab CI** - Integrated DevOps platform
- **TektonCI** - Kubernetes-native CI/CD
- **ArgoCD** - GitOps continuous delivery
- **AWS CodePipeline** - Cloud-native CI/CD

### Infrastructure & Automation
My approach is grounded in **automation and containerization**:
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Ansible, Terraform
- **Container Technologies**: Docker, Podman
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Amazon EKS
- **Platform Experience**: On-premise servers, AWS Cloud

### Observability & Monitoring
To ensure systems are not just running but are healthy and performant, I focus on **comprehensive observability**:
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Logging**: Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Vector)
- **Tracing**: Zipkin, Jaeger
- **Alerting**: AlertManager, PagerDuty integration

### Programming & Scripting
This is all supported by a solid foundation in programming:
- **Java** - Enterprise application development
- **Python** - Automation and data processing
- **Bash** - System administration and scripting
- **Go** - Cloud-native tool development

## üìà Professional Philosophy

> "The best way to predict the future is to create it through reliable, scalable, and automated systems."

I believe in:
- **Automation First**: If you do it twice, automate it
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything should be version controlled
- **Observability**: You can't improve what you can't measure
- **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves, and so should we
